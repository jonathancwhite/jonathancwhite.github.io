          <p>I am a freelance web developer who is currently attending Auburn University to receive a Bachelors in Computer Science. My original goal with my education was to focus on Cybersecurity because I thought that I could be some cool hacker guy that shows portray. However, when I began my journey at Auburn I noticed that Software Engineering/Computer Science is much harder than movies and TV shows make it out to be. There are countless amount of hours of practice you need to put in on top of the assignments that are due every week. While the projects are enjoyable and the information is very intriguing, my struggle for making rent every month led me to take on a side-hustle in web design. </p>
              
          <p>I first got into web design because I wanted to make a personal website for my gaming career and didn't have the money to pay someone to make one for me. I spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials and reading books on HTML and CSS. Every moment that I could spend working on learning to code my own website, I did just that. Now after two years or so of small projects, I have decided to further my search for information and experience in web development. You can reach out to me if you have any questions by sending me an email or giving me a call/text. All contact information can be found <a href="contact.html">here.</a></p>
